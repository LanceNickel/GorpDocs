        <h1>Instance Resource Allocation</h1>

        <p>It is important to allocate the correct resources to each instance. By default, all instances are allocated 4G of RAM. This can be changed in the <a href="configuration.html">configuration file</a>, however <a href="customize.html">per-instance configurations</a> may need to be made as well.</p>

        <p>It is important to consider how the instance will be used. Several factors will affect performance:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>How many players will be online at any one time.</li>
            <li>What these players might be doing (I.E: Lots of redstone, etc.)</li>
            <li>Where these players are (if everyone's in different locations, more of the world will be loaded at once).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Minecraft is (mostly) single-threaded, so CPU clock speed matters more than cores. As long as you have any recent quad-core processor with a decent clock speed, you should be okay in the CPU department. Examples of good Minecraft processors would be a recent Core i5, Core i7, Ryzen 3, or Ryzen 5.</p>

        <p><strong class="red">Please read:</strong> For the best performance, use Paper MC. It is much more efficient than the vanilla Minecraft server JAR. Gorp is created for and uses Paper MC. You don't have to change any settings to get the benefits of Paper MC. Should you use a <a href="custom-jar.html">custom server JAR</a>, please consider the performance of the JAR you are using and follow the developer's recommendations.</p>

        <h3>This is my personal guideline that has worked well for me:</h3>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Player Count</th>
                <th>View Distance</th>
                <th>RAM Allocated</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>1-5</td>
                <td>15 chunks</td>
                <td>2 GB</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>6-10</td>
                <td>15 chunks</td>
                <td>5 GB</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>11-20</td>
                <td>15 chunks</td>
                <td>10 GB</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>This was on a machine with 16 GB total RAM and an Intel Core i7-6700K processor (on the older side, but still plenty for Minecraft).</p>
